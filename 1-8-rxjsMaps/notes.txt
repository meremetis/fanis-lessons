### RxJS Operators

**exhaustMap**
- Takes the first of many subscriptions if they are not finished (e.g., with debounce). If it goes 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5, only (1) is executed.

**switchMap**
- Takes the last of many subscriptions if they are not finished (e.g., with debounce). If it goes 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5, only (5) is executed.

**mergeMap**
- Sends all requests in parallel, even if they are not finished (i.e., it didn't return any value yet). It goes 1/2/3/4/5 at the same time.

**concatMap**
- Sends multiple requests in sequence, waiting for the first to complete before sending the next one. It goes 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5.

**map**
- Takes a value and returns a value.

### Observable Creation

**from**
- Creates an observable and sends values one by one. If it was an array, it would create an observable for each item.

**of**
- Creates an observable from the whole array, so the returned observable contains the entire array.

### Angular Component Utilities

**destroyRef**
- Holds the reference of the component's initialization.

**takeUntilDestroyed**
- If used inside a constuctor, it takes the initialization reference by default. If used outside a constuctor, you need to explicitly provide the reference.

### Additional Functions

**debounceTime**
- Executes the operators below it after a given time.

**JavaScript map**
- Takes an array and returns a new array.
